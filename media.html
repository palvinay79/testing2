                  Al-Rajhi also mentioned in his interview with Argaam during his presence in the Forum of Future Investment held in Riyadh, that these companies met very tough challenges, because they embraced idle forces that do not cope with the desired production capacity, yet this situation will not continue as Al-Rajhi said, as we will witness a significant breakthrough soon which will greatly help companies in growing their profits and stock values.<br/><br/>                
                  Furthermore he added, it is true that some stocks have started to rise slightly, but the risk remains available in the stocks of non-profitable companies with unfortunate history even if it had a long track record of 20 years, and I think it will be difficult for similar companies to survive, as it may collapse upon the entry of new companies to the financial market  as they are expected to achieve returns and distribute profits."<br/><br/>                
                  About Manafea Investment Company, Al-Rajhi explained that the company's real estate portfolio is diversified in the industrial, real estate and hotel sectors, adding that it intends to focus on the tourism and leisure sector in line with the government’s vision.</p>

Al-Rajhi also mentioned in his interview with Argaam during his presence in the Forum of Future Investment held in Riyadh, that these companies met very tough challenges, because they embraced idle forces that do not cope with the desired production capacity, yet this situation will not continue as Al-Rajhi said, as we will witness a significant breakthrough soon which will greatly help companies in growing their profits and stock values.<br/><br/>

Furthermore he added, it is true that some stocks have started to rise slightly, but the risk remains available in the stocks of non-profitable companies with unfortunate history even if it had a long track record of 20 years, and I think it will be difficult for similar companies to survive, as it may collapse upon the entry of new companies to the financial market  as they are expected to achieve returns and distribute profits."<br/><br/>

About Manafea Investment Company, Al-Rajhi explained that the company's real estate portfolio is diversified in the industrial, real estate and hotel sectors, adding that it intends to focus on the tourism and leisure sector in line with the government’s vision.</p>
